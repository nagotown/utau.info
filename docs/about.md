# About utau.info

utau.info is a help site for people who want to get into UTAU.

This website is based on [utau.us](https://utau.us), which has gone dormant and is incomplete, so I aim to create a more finished product. (No disrespect to the author. They are aware I am creating this website.)

Contributions are welcome! A form of contact should be available at some point in the future.
