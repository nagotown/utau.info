## Changing Locale

To use UTAU and and its plugins, you must change your locale to Japanese. This will not change your system language, but will change backslashes into yen signs in console.

Change your PC's Locale to Japanese by going to `Control Panel > Clock and Region > Change date, time, or number formats > Administrative > Change System Locale > Japanese (Japan)`.

You may also need to change the units of measurement for UTAU to function correctly. To do this, go to `Control Panel > Clock and Region > Change date, time, or number formats > Additional Settings... > Numbers`. Make sure the decimal symbol is `.`, and the digit grouping symbol is `,`.
