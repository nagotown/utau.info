# Voicebank Types

In UTAU, there are various formats of voicebanks. Each of them are used differently.

Each note is represented by 1 mora. A mora is one consonant-vowel pair, or a single vowel. Most voicebanks use kana aliasing, which uses Japanese characters.

There are romaji (romanization of japanese characters) aliased voicebanks, but the standard is to use kana aliasing.

Aliasing is how each mora is registered in the oto.ini, which is the configuration file for UTAU voicebanks.

The way that voicebank formats are named is by how you type the notes in the piano roll.

For example, `C` represents a consonant, and `V` represents a vowel.
