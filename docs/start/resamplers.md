## What is a Resampler?

A resampler is an engine for UTAU --- The sound of your voicebank can change in different ways depending on which one you use, for example, one resampler may make a voicebank with more breathy samples sound better, or another making high notes sound more nasally.

## Options

Popular resamplers include the default resampler, [doppeltler](/resources/resamplers/#doppeltler), [moresampler](/resources/resamplers/#moresampler), and [f2resamp](/resources/resamplers/#f2resamp).
