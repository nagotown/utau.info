## What is UTAU?

UTAU is a shareware singing synthesis program released in 2008, similar to VOCALOID. Unlike VOCALOID, creating voicebanks for it can be done by anyone, so the community has provided many voicebanks that support singing in many languages, with most of them being free!

Because UTAU is shareware, there is a paid version that you can purchase to support the developer, but most of the community uses the free version. The differences between the two are pretty small. More information can be found [here](http://utau.us/share.html).
