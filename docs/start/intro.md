## What is UTAU?

UTAU is a shareware singing synthesis program released in 2008, similar to VOCALOID. Unlike VOCALOID, creating voicebanks for it can be done by anyone, so the community has provided many voicebanks that support singing in many languages, with most of them being free!

## What is this website?

`utau.info` aims to be an updated and beginner-friendly resource for both new and experienced UTAU users.

Everything you need to know to setup and use UTAU as a beginner will be taught here, and eventually more advanced topics will be covered.
