## About Plugins

Plugins are programs that make UTAU easier to use.  
Traditionally, they modify lyrics, timing, flags, or tuning.

You can find a list of plugins to download [here.](/resources/plugins/)

## Installation

### Method 1

Drag and drop the plugin archive (`.zip`, `.uar`) into the UTAU window.  
If this doesn't work, follow Method 2.

### Method 2

In the UTAU window, go to `Tools(T) > Plug-Ins(N) > Open Plug-Ins Folder(0)`.  
Extract the plugin's .zip file into its own folder within the plugins folder.

## Usage

To launch a plugin, `Tools(T) > Plug-Ins(N)`, then click the name of the plugin you want to use.

Each plugin is used differently, so they will either come with a readme file or have instructions on the site you downloaded it from. If the readme is in Japanese, use a translator.
